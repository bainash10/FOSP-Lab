 <p>KhEC is Nepal's first community-based engineering college, undertaken by Bhaktapur Municipality. It is centrally located at culturally rich city Bhaktapur, KhEC will, in every regard, be the right destination for those who aspire to become professional engineers and architects at affordable fees.</p> 

With a distant vision of maintaining Bhaktapur's hard-won glory, the college aims to produce highly skilled engineers/architects that will have blends of both indigenous and modern-day technologies.
